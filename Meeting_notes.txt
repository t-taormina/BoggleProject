April 13 (Freddy)
Jotted down contact info and began going over pseudo code/ flow charts 
and how we are going to structure our project, also decided who would do what in the project.

April 20(Tyler)
Began by going over certain questions we had about the program,
We then went over new functions we would be working on and assigned them. 
Also chatted a bit about other work needed for the project

April 25(Rayyan)
We went over more functions, also had Tyler and Freddy help me 
With understanding their functions we also went over more code 
To better understand how the board will work

April 30(Freddy)
Me and Tyler began going over functions that would help keep the board in bounds 
And rayyan helped fix some errors while also explaining them!


May 4(Tyler)
We began going over more code to help build the board
We then went over more error we were running into during our testing phase


May 11(Rayyan)
After fixing most of the errors we decided to create more functions that would
Allow the computer to search the dictionary through a binary search tree


May 18(Freddy)
Once we understood how the binary search tree would be implemented 
Into our program we began implementing it, we also just worked on fixing more errors


May 25(Tyler)
After being able to search the dictionary we began working on 
Randomizing the board for the user to do a regular play/ or user inputted play



May 28(Rayyan)
After finally finishing most of the necessary functions we began finalizing all of our work 
We also are going to finish any of the last necessary errors
